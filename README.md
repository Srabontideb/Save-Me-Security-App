# Save-Me(Security App)
The project involves creating a user database by collecting names and trustworthy contact numbers with each user required to provide five phone numbers. In case of an emergency, the user can press a button to send their location via GPS and request help. The app will then send a message with their location to the provided trustworthy contacts and enable them to call emergency services (999). Additionally, users can send messages to anyone except the contacts they've provided.
